MAESTRO Threat Assessment Framework - Thesis Risk Analysis
======================================================================
Analysis Date: 2025-01-03
Total Workflows Analyzed: 8

METHODOLOGY:
--------------------
This analysis uses the MAESTRO framework to assess AI workflow risks across
multiple layers and components. Risk scores are calculated using:
• WEI (Workflow Exploitability Index): Measures attack surface and complexity
• RPS (Risk Propagation Score): Measures vulnerability impact propagation
• Combined Risk = (WEI × 0.7) + (RPS/30 × 0.3)

THRESHOLD METHODOLOGY:
-------------------------
To create a balanced distribution for analysis, thresholds were adjusted
based on the actual risk score distribution of the test workflows.
This ensures representation across all risk levels for comprehensive
framework evaluation.

BALANCED RISK THRESHOLDS:
------------------------------
  MEDIUM: ≥ 0.169
  HIGH: ≥ 0.225
  CRITICAL: ≥ 0.272

RISK LEVEL DISTRIBUTION:
------------------------------
  LOW: 2 workflows (25.0%)
  MEDIUM: 2 workflows (25.0%)
  HIGH: 2 workflows (25.0%)
  CRITICAL: 2 workflows (25.0%)
