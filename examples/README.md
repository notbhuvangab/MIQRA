## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Patterns

### Protocol Interoperability
Each workflow implements a **semantic bridge** that enables:
- **Context Preservation**: MCP model contexts are maintained across A2A agent communications
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Bidirectional data flow between MCP and A2A components
- **Protocol Translation**: Automatic conversion between MCP and A2A message formats
- **Security Integration**: Unified security controls across both protocol types

### Common Interoperability Features
```yaml
interoperability:
  mcp_a2a_bridge:
    enabled: true
    translation_layer: "semantic_protocol_bridge"
    context_preservation: true
    bidirectional_communication: true
```

### Security and Compliance
All workflows include:
- **Data Encryption**: In-transit and at-rest encryption
- **Access Controls**: Role-based and attribute-based access control
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for all protocol interactions
- **Privacy Protection**: Domain-specific privacy preservation techniques
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Industry-specific compliance frameworks
