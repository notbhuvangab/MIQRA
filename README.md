# MAESTRO Threat Assessment Framework

A comprehensive security risk assessment tool for agentic workflows using the MAESTRO (Model, Agent framework, Ecosystem, Security, Threat landscape, Risk mitigation, Operational oversight) framework.

## Overview

The MAESTRO Threat Assessment Framework provides enterprise-grade security analysis for AI agentic workflows. It implements the latest MAESTRO security framework with enhanced risk quantification formulas, including:

- **Workflow Exploitability Index (WEI)** - MAESTRO-layered vulnerability assessment
- **Risk Propagation Score (RPS)** - Cross-layer risk analysis
- **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** - Enterprise cost impact evaluation
- **Comprehensive Reporting** - Executive summaries and detailed technical reports
- **Interactive Web GUI** - Modern web interface with flowchart visualization

## Features

### Core Capabilities

- **YAML Workflow Parsing**: Parse and analyze workflow definitions with agent interactions and data flows
- **Vulnerability Identification**: Automatic detection of security risks across all MAESTRO layers
- **Risk Quantification**: Calculate WEI and RPS scores using CSA 2025 threat statistics
- **Cost Assessment**: Enterprise cost estimation with ROI analysis
- **Multiple Output Formats**: CLI, JSON, tables, and executive summaries
- **Interactive Web GUI**: Modern Streamlit-based interface with interactive visualizations

### üåê Web GUI Features

The MAESTRO framework now includes a comprehensive web interface with:

- **üì§ YAML Workflow Upload**: Drag-and-drop or paste workflow definitions
- **üîÑ Interactive Flowchart**: Visualize workflow steps with threat mapping and severity colors
- **‚öôÔ∏è Configurable Risk Parameters**: Customize LayerWeight_l, ExposureIndex_l, VulnerabilityComplexity_l, and EnterpriseCost_l

```bash
maestro cost-estimate --enterprise-size enterprise --industry financial
```

### Python API

```python
from maestro_threat_assessment import MAESTROEngine

# Initialize engine
engine = MAESTROEngine()

# Perform assessment
report = engine.assess_workflow_from_file(
    'workflow.yaml',
    base_infrastructure_cost=200000,
    enterprise_size='large',
    industry='financial'
)

# Access results
print(f"Risk Level: {report.risk_assessment.risk_level}")
print(f"WEI Score: {report.risk_assessment.total_wei}")
print(f"TCO: ${report.cost_assessment.total_tco:,.0f}")
```

## Workflow Format

MAESTRO accepts YAML workflow definitions with the following structure:

```yaml
workflow:
  name: "Your Workflow Name"
  description: "Description of the workflow"
  metadata:
    version: "1.0"
    category: "financial"  # financial, healthcare, etc.
    sensitivity: "high"    # low, medium, high
  
  steps:
    - id: "step_1"
      agent: "AgentName"
      action: "action_name"
      params:
        key: "value"
      dependencies: []
    
    - id: "step_2"
      agent: "AnotherAgent"
      action: "process_data"
      input_from: "AgentName"
      dependencies: ["step_1"]
```

## Advanced Features

### Custom Cost Models
Override default cost estimates with your infrastructure costs:

```bash
maestro assess workflow.yaml --base-cost 500000
```

### Vulnerability Extensions
The framework is designed to be extensible. Add custom vulnerability detection rules by extending the `WorkflowParser` class.

### Integration Ready
- JSON API for integration with existing security tools
- Programmatic access via Python API
- CI/CD pipeline integration capabilities

## Security Considerations

- All assessments are performed locally - no data leaves your environment
- Workflow files should be treated as sensitive configuration
- Cost estimates are based on industry averages and should be validated
- Regular updates recommended as threat landscape evolves
